# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that the code, program , or software is functional and secure I would first try to understand the requirements throurougly. Then I would develop a testing strategy that covers unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. I would Write test cases to ensure that my software meets its requirements all while following coding standards and best practices. Software security practices I have learnt would also be implemented along with regular security testing so I can ensure my code is not vulnerable to threats that can cause issues.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by conducting user research such as interviews, surveys or usablity tests. From there I would create a user centered design and gather feedback along the process from users while making adjustments along the way.

# How do I approach designing software?

Breaking down the software in smaller components is a good way to help with desinging a software. Take small steps and analyze each section throughly and ensure the compatability from different components. I would ensure that the software is scalable to ensure growth won't be a issue. A friendly user interface is another approach to designing software as you want to make sure the user can easily learn the software and have a great experience. Error handling is another important feauture as you want to make sure errors get handled as properly as possible and don't break the software.
